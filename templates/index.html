						<h4 class="title">Unique investment policy</h4>
						<p>The uniqueness lies in owning a diversified portfolio of real estate with good fundamental characteristics, as described below.

						<h4 class="title">Diversification and Asset Allocation</h4>
						<p>The Board of Directors believes that in order to maximize the stability of the Company's revenues, the best strategy is to invest in a portfolio of assets diversified by location, sector, asset size and exposure to tenants with low vacancy rates and creditable tenants. The value of any individual asset at the time of its acquisition should not exceed 15% of gross assets, and the share of rental income received from one tenant should not exceed 10%.</p>
